The text to 3D model components uses Dall-E2. For using the text to 3D model component, insert your OpenAI API key in the `keys/keys.py` file.
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Usage
Run the following command in your terminal. It helps to specify a specific object such as "A monkey vase"
```
# Generate from text
python main.py --prompt "Your prompt of an object"

# Generate from image
python main.py --input_image "Path to your input image"
```

## Limitations
* Can only generate mirrorable objects. Complex objects like chairs are not recommended.
